#Code comments in spanish

The 'main' class asks the user to introduce the amount of disks that'll be placed on the first tower, then asks the user if he wants (or not) to show the Tower status at each iteration (if choosed 'no', this status will only be displayed at the beginning and the end of the process), then it solves the game showing the movement realized for each iteration.
